        <b>Not sure which?</b> Get v1.1. Hand tracking stays off until you switch it on, so until then it works just
        like v1.0. Pick v1.0 if you don’t want camera features at all or want a slightly smaller download (~110MB vs
        ~119MB). Both share the same saved scores, so you can switch any time.

          Why I made it

        <Text c="dark.1" size="sm">
          I couldn’t drag click. I’d watched people do it, bought grip tape and tried for ages, and still only got two
          clicks a drag. Every guide said “just drag your finger across it”, and none of them helped me work out what I
          was doing wrong. So I built the tool I wished I’d had: one that counts the clicks in every drag, shows whether
          I’m getting better, and gives me an idea of what to change. I’m still learning with it myself.
