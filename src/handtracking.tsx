        Drag Trainer uses <b>MediaPipe</b>, a free hand tracker made by Google. It looks at every frame of the video, up
        to the frame rate you pick in the Hand tracking panel, and finds 21 points on your hand: your wrist, every knuckle and every fingertip. Join the
        dots and you get a stick-figure skeleton of your hand, which you can see drawn over the camera preview.
      </>,
      <>
        The part that matters most for drag clicking is your clicking finger, from its middle knuckle to its tip, so
        that’s drawn in green.
      </>,

    title: 'You show it where the button is',
    body: [
      <>
        The camera can see your hand, but it has no idea where your mouse button is. So you calibrate: press{' '}
        <b>Mark back</b> and hold your fingertip on the back of the button during the 3 second countdown, then press{' '}
        <b>Mark front</b> and do the same on the front edge.
      </>,
      <>
        It takes your fingertip’s position over the last half second of each countdown, so a tiny wobble doesn’t
        throw it off, and draws the button as a dashed orange line. Every measurement after that is made relative to
        that line, which is why you need to calibrate again if the camera moves.

        Every video frame is stamped with the moment the camera took it, on the same clock as your clicks. When a drag
        ends, the app picks out just the frames from your first click to your last, so it knows exactly what your hand
        was doing during that drag and nothing else.

  {
    title: 'It measures what your finger did',

      <>From those frames it works out:</>,
      <>
        <b>Finger angle:</b> how steep your finger is compared with the button. Flat is 0°, pointing straight down is
        90°.
      </>,
      <>
        <b>Start spot:</b> where along the button your fingertip was when the drag began: at the back, in the middle or
        near the front edge.
      </>,
      <>
        <b>Length and speed:</b> how far your fingertip slid along the button and how quickly.
      </>,
      <>
        <b>Lift:</b> whether your fingertip rose off the button partway through, which usually means the clicks stop.
      </>,
      <>
        <b>Steadiness:</b> how much your finger angle changed during the drag.
      </>,
      <>
        Distances are measured in “hand sizes” rather than pixels, so it doesn’t matter how close the camera is. To show
        them in cm it assumes an average hand, which is why the cm numbers are only rough.

        After 8 tracked drags it switches to comparing you with yourself. It sorts your drags by how many clicks they
        got, then compares the best third with the worst third. If your best drags start nearer the front, or with a
        steeper finger, it tells you, and puts a green circle on the preview where your best drags start.
      </>,
      <>
        There’s no single right way to drag click, because every finger and mouse is different. Learning from your own
        best drags means the tips fit you, not someone else.

        If you tick <b>Record my drags</b>, it keeps the last few seconds of small video frames in memory. When a drag

        drag good or bad. Open <b>Replays</b> to watch them back in slow motion or frame by frame, with every click
        marked.

        Each marking (hand, finger, button line, target spot and click flash) can be switched on or off, or hide them all
        to see just your hand. Clips from your last 10 sessions are kept, and you can delete them all from the Replays
